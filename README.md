# Week 3 #
### September 12th, 2024 ###
It's Wednesday, I am watching grasshopper youtube videos and have made this shape. I understood the fundamentals and how operations work.</br>

</br>
I also made a 3d model for the mobile stand so that i dont have to attach the two legs separately. The design allows e to attach my phone while the stand is horizontal and then prop it up. I didn't realise I could do this until Chris Myers pointed it out.</br>

I worked on creating the diagram for the grasshopper file for the mobile phone. </br>

It's Tuesday, I am sitting in the MDes studio waiting for my plant stand 3d print while I am trying to sketch ideas for the phone stand. I made a rough prototype using figma and laser cut 0.25" wood to make it. It somehow works Lol. If I poke the phone (try to use the touch screen) it wobbles and might fall. It also doesnt work in landscape mode.

It is Monday night and as I was browsing amazon I saw the most amazing laptop stand I have ever seen. I am thinking of making a phone stand like this that works on the principles of balance and center of mass rather than a solid block with a line carved out to keep the phone.

I tried grasshopper over the weekend. I was had used Fusion in college but never knew that design could be encoded in such a workflow. I found it fascinating. I love automation and love making block diagrams. This method of using logical flows to breakdown components of designs essentially means that the design will always work (functionally) if the parameters are entered correctly. I am more interested in AR/VR and UI/UX design, but have to admit that I did find the use of workflows in physical design quite fascinating. Don't know if I would want to master grasshopper, but I would deffinetely want to explore more. I have added a few screenshots below where I tried using a cone for the inner shape of the stand. I also tried changing the outer shape from cylinder to sphere but that didn't work and I dont know why yet.

# Week 2 #
### September 5th, 2024 ###

This week I learned how to laser print. I spent almost an hour printing the same design 4 times. Initally I had issues with my design not being recognized as cutable even with red and 0.01 stroke(pro tip: import filled svg and then add stroke to it). The first two designs didnt cut through and the third one broke. So I increased the material width in settings and changed the design a bit to increase thickness in thin areas and viola got the third design perfectly. I wanted to make a Cal keychain because the Cal merchendise is typically very expensive to purchase. I am confident, given a design, I can laser cut with any material in one go quickly. I also helped a friend with her first laser cutting mission.

# Github Background Information & Context
If you‚Äôre new to GitHub, you can think of this as a shared file space (like a Google Drive folder, or a like a USB drive that‚Äôs hosted online.) 

This is your space to store project files, videos, PDFs, notes, images, etc., and (hopefully, neatly) organize so it's easy for viewers (and you!) to navigate. That said, it‚Äôs super easy for you to share any file or folder with us (your TDF instructional team) - just send us the link!  As a start, feel free to simply add images to the `/assets` folder, which is located [here](/assets). 

The specific file that I‚Äôm typing into right now is the **README.md** for this repo. 
##### (üí° TIP: The .md indicates that we‚Äôre using [Markdown formatting.](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)) #####
<h6> (üí° TIP 2: GitHub Markdown supports <a href="https://gist.github.com/seanh/13a93686bf4c2cb16e658b3cf96807f2"> <em>HTML formatting</em> too, including emojis üòÑ</a>, in case that helps!) </h6>

### :star: Whatever you write in your **README.md** will show up on the ‚Äúfront page‚Äù of your GitHub repo. This is where we‚Äôll be looking for your [weekly progress reports](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/24f-desinv-202/wiki/3.0-Weekly-Submissions#weekly-progress-report). They might look something like this: ###

# Week 1: Example Report 1 #
## Week of 09/05/2024

This week, I designed a cool phone stand made of rocks. Check out all my cool sketches and progress photos from this week below, etc., etc....

It's time to start making this space your own! If you want to save these instructions, make a copy.  Also, feel empowered to delete everything in this README.md and start documenting! 

Excited to work with you,
your TDF teaching team

PS: let us know if you have any questions!!
